# linux-server-configuration
Linux (Ubuntu) configuration using _Virtual Box, Vagrant, AWS Lightsail, AWS EC2 and many others ..._

Although there isn't too much to see, in this _example project_ I could:
- Configure a virtual machine
- Configure the firewall to only allow access to some ports (including SSH)
- Configure the SSH access
- Forward the host ports to be accessed by guest ones
- Manage user access
- Install some apps like PostgreSQL, Git and Apache 

All these steps were done locally, in the **AWS Lightsail** and **AWS EC2** 

_This README is just a very simple initial version. The idea is to let documented all was done._
